Maven (Ninja framework) for centralPay

I use the NINja framework built off Maven to developed a restful webservice
that consume the web service of Nibss.

There are dependencies based of the host end point which the organisation
that developed the web service.

However the code base is explicit and clearly show what we are trying to acheive.

NOTE: The project is already complied, you will need jd-gui to get the source code.
the important one is the centralpay.jar
